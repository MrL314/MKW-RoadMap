- Green lines are "Secondary Roads", not used in races
- Red lines are Railroad Lines
- Gray Dotted Lines are "Flight Paths"
- Blue Dotted Lines are "Water Paths"

## Roads Only (Transparent Map)

### This project is incomplete as of the moment.
1) Roads inside the themed tracks themselves are not complete as of yet
2) The road lines are very close to accurate, but I would say they are within maybe 3-5px in each direction of the actual location
3) I would like to eventually vectorize the roadmap (however I am not skilled with vectorizing artwork programs)
4) Battle Tracks are a bit trickier to include (especially Salty Salty Speedway as it makes the map a lot harder to interpret)
5) Height information is not directly implied in the map yet
6) Secondary map features (like Koopa Beach 1) are not fully included yet
